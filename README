USB ACM with raw IrDA IO for a MMstm32F107 module:
http://www.propox.com/products/t_264.html?lang=en
By 'raw' IrDA I mean byte-wise 3/16 RZI SIR without framing.
Normal serial IO can be used by removing -DUSE_IRDA from the Makefile.

Based on https://github.com/znuh/STM32_VCP and 
the UM0424 STM32 USB-FS-Device firmware library Virtual COM port example.
